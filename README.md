# Image-Steganography
Hides some data into an Image, and can successfully decode the same data from that image.

#### Encryption Algorithm used : Least Significant Bit Technique (LSB)

User just needs to provide :
  - cover image
  - data which needs to be hidden
  - name of the final encoded image
  - path where final image will be stored

The program itself creates a copy of the image, hides the data in that copy and saves the encoded image in user's choice of path with user's choice of name.
